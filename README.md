# TileVania
*Date Made:* Feb 2019

The game idea was from a Udemy Course for Unity 2D, but I implemented the mechanics of the game, rather then just copying along with the instructor. The things that I learned were the main things that I was following the instructor, but I didn't follow them blindly rather I learned how to do them.

## What I learned:
	-[x] Creating 2D Animation and animation transitions
	-[x] Learned using Unity Particles system
	-[x] Learning Cinemachine
	-[x] Learned Cinemachine Camera State
	-[x] Transition from one scene to the next
	-[x] Tile maps and Tile rules
	
## How The Game Looks
